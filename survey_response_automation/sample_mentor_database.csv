They elaborated on their research interests with the following: 'I have a huge interest in understanding how an entire organism develops from a single cell,  how different cell types arise from the same genomic background: it is amazing to think about all the mechanisms regulating the expression of genes differently depending on the pathway a cell has to take to become a certain lineage. Also, it would be fascinating to understand how every cell coordinates with each other to allow the organism to develop and work correctly.'

""I am interested in behavioral neuroscience, specifically the effect of hormones in behavior and how environmental and other psychological factors can influence the development of behavior and how hormones develop and interact with other biological aspects. I am also interested in TBI and subsequent behavior.

Within the cognitive neuroscience field I am interested in learning and memory. How we learn and how we retain that information, and how sex derived hormones can affect these processes (I hesitate to say male-female differences because of all the variables that exist outside of a lab in regards to application, ie environmental and psychological factors related to gender). 

In both of these fields I'm interested in researching through the lens of gender, not just plainly biologically but I would also like to study this from a larger perspective. From my course experience in my undergraduate I not only valued the knowledge that can be develop in a lab setting, but also the importance of contextualizing this knowledge on a larger scale. Why the lab work matters, what the end goal is with doing a particular research project. Communicating science is something that I'm passionate about. Making science accessible is not only showing other upcoming students the way or providing opportunities to grow in science. It is also about being able to communicate science to non-scientists. After all, it's for others that we do the work that we do.""

If they don't reach out within 1 week, please email them to remind them to send you their materials., You must keep all the information the scholars send you confidential., Provide constructive feedback on the scholar's statements., Set expectations for drafts revisions between the two of you. For example, establish if your scholar should have a new draft two or three weeks ready after you've provided feedback., Provide encouragement and support. The majority of our scholars experienced a confidence boost by having another scientist read their statements and affirm they have the skills to start a PhD. The scholars really appreciate your support!, If your scholar misses an expected deadline you set, please send them a reminder. If they do not reply within a week, check in again and let us know if you think there is a problem of their commitment to the program., Please reply to your scholar within 1 week of an email they send you, it could just be a confirmation that you received their material or updated draft and you will get back to them at a specified later date., Establish if they can contact you through email and phone or only email.
